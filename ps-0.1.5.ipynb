    "## 0. Why Are We Making You Do This?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we are doing this because our section leaders are overworked: teaching online takes more time and effort than teaching in person, and our section leaders were not overpaid before the 'Rona arrived on these shores. Taking the bulk of the work of grading calculation assignments off of their backs is a plus—and it appears that the best way for us to do that is to distribute a number of the course assignements to you in this form: the form of a python computer language \"jupyter notebook\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we are doing this because learning Jupyter Notebooks and Python may well turn out to be the intellectual equivalent for you of \"eat your spinach\": something that may seem unpleasant and unappetizing now, but that makes you stronger and more capable. In 1999 Python programming language creator Guido van Rossem compared the ability to read, write, and use software you had built or modified yourself to search and analyze data and information collections. Guido predicted that mass programming, if it could be attained, would produce increases in societal power and changes in societal organization of roughly the same magnitude as mass literacy has had over the past several centuries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Guido may be right, and he may be wrong. But what is clear is that your lives may be richer, and you may have more options, if the data science and basic programming intellectual tools become a useful part of your intellectual panoplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analogy: An anology: Back in the medieval European university, people would learn the Trivium—the 'trivial' subjects of Grammar (how to write), Rhetoric (how to speak in public), and lLogic (how to think coherently)—then they would learn the Quadrivium of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music/Harmony, and Astronomy/Astrology; and last they would learn the advanced and professional subjects: Law or Medicine or Theology and Physics, Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy. \n",
    "\n",
    "But a student would also learn two more things: how to learn by reading—how to take a book and get something useful out of it, without a requiring a direct hands-on face-to-face teacher; and (2) how to write a _fine chancery hand_ so that they could prepare their own documents, for submission to secular courts or to religious bishops or even just put them in a form where they would be easily legible to any educated audience back in those days before screens-and-attachments, before screens-and-printers, before typewriters, before printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Science tools may well turn out to be in the first half of the 2000s the equivalent of a _fine chancery hand_, just as a facility with the document formats and commands of the Microsoft office suite were the equivalent of a _fine chancery hand_ at the end of the 1900s: practical, general skills that make you of immense value to most if not nearly all organizations. This—along with the ability to absorb useful knowledge without requiring hands-on person-to-person face-to-face training—will greatly boost your social power and your set of opportunities in your life. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are right about its value. \n",
    "\n",
    "I know a number of Berkeley graduates who in 2009 kept their jobs—and now have very good careers—solely because they knew then how to make Microsoft Office get up and dance, while the people to their right to their left, in front and behind them in the cubicle farm did not and so were let go when the U.S. unemployment rate spiked in the Great Recession. Literonumeracy in Microsoft Office was, 15 years ago, the then-equivalent of being able to write a _fine chancery hand_. We suspect the Data Science tools will be the counterpart for the next fifteen years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, why Jupyter and Python, rather than R-studio and R, or C++ and Matlab? Because jupyter Project founder Fernando Perez has an office on the fourth floor of Evans. Because 40% of Berkeley undergraduates currently take Data 8 and so, taking account of other channels, more than half of Berkeley students are already going to graduate literonumerate in Python.\n",

We assume that every 1% increase in average standards of living with population held constant. is associated with an equiproportional 1% increase in the value of our ideas index. That is also a calibration: it is easier to interpret the index as a value if it scales with living standards and productivity levels. And we assume that every 1% increases in human population with average standards of living held constant is associated with an 0.5% increase in the value in the value of the ideas index. That is a guess, or more politely a judgment: a higher human population means smaller average farm sizes and less abundant raw materials available for the typical craftworker; thus human living standards would be lower unless greater natural resource scarcity were not counterbalanced by better ideas about how to produce useful things; the judgment—and it is contestable—is that over the millennia and on average resources have been only half as salient as ideas in enabling the economic efficiency of human labor.\n",

    "You may feel that we have gone through a lot of extra and unnecessary work to create these dataframes. If you are familiar with a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, you may wonder why we don't just use a spreadsheet to hold and then do calculations with the data in this small table that is `long_run_growth_df`. Indeed, Bob Frankston and Dan Bricklin who implemented and designed the original Visicalc were geniuses. Visicalc was a tremendously useful advance over earlier mainframe-based report generators, such as ITS's Business Planning Language <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc>>. And today's Microsoft Excel is not that great an advance over Jonathan Sachs's Lotus 1-2-3, which was itself close to being merely a knockoff of Visicalc. Why not follow the line of least resistance? Why not do our data analysis and visualization in a spreadsheet?\n",

It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer’s spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform. A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer’s apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring.... Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended... \n",
