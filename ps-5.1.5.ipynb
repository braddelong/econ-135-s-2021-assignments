    "### A. The Argument for Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument for \"convergence\" of economies has two parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first, less important, part is that economies should converge in their savings-investment rates and in their population and labor force growth rates. Countries with low savings-investment rates have low capital intensity. Countries with high population and labor force growth rates have low capital intensity. The factors reinforce each other. And countries with low capital intensity are poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As countries grow absolutely richer, their relative price structures see the price of manufactured investment goods fall, and so the same share of income saved translates into a greater real share of investment in spending: the same savings effort translates into a greater investment outcome. Moreover, richer countries find it much easier to maintain the security of property, which raises the incentive to save and invest as well. This has countries grow absolutely richer, their real savings-investment rates converge. And this convergence removes one source of low capital intensity, and poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "As countries grow absolutely richer, infant mortality rates fall and literacy rates rise. This leads countries to go through the \"demographic transition\": a shift from fertility rates above 40 per thousand as couples seek to have more children in the hopes that some will survive down to about 10 per thousand. Before the demographic transition begins populations grow very very slowly because of high death rates. In the middle of the process population growth rates are high, hence countries' levels of capital intensity are low as savings are devoted to simply equipping the growing labor force with tools rather than increasing the number and value of tools at the disposal of each worker. But after countries have completed the demographic transition they have converged in their rates of population and labor-force growth to values near zero population growth. And this convergence removes one source of low capital intensity, and poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "More important than convergence in capital intensity and thus in this factor's effect on relative incomes—so the argument goes—is convergence in the level of technology deployed in different economies. Development is easier than discovery, and deployment is easier than development. Discovery must take place, overwhelmingly, in the leading edge growth poles of the world economy. But development can take place in any of a wide range of places with sufficiently developed communities of engineering practice. And deployment can take place anywhere that people are literate, experienced with the use of modern technology, and confident that their effort at deploying technologies in production will be satisfactorily rewarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once, therefore, countries' economies have developed sufficient degrees of literacy and sufficiently strong communities of engineering practice to begin to transfer technology from abroad and deploy it in their economies—once they have made what Walt Rostow used to analogize as the \"takeoff\" into self-sustained growth, first industrial growth and then modern economic growth—there are then very powerful economic incentives for them to adopt, adopt, and deploy modern technologies for manipulating nature and productively organizing humans, and hence their levels of efficiency of labor should rapidly converge to the standard of economic leaders.\n",

Will Baumol—a very smart and creative man, a true gentleman, shame on the Nobel Prize committee for preferring a lot of people whose contributions were much less than his—argued that if we looked at the world since 1870, and if we looked at the countries that had then managed the takeoff into self sustained growth, the overwhelming message of the data was one of \"convergence\". I thought that if you looked at the data more carefully, that Baumol was wrong.\n",

Japan was selected because it had grown rich between 1870 and 1979, and back in 1979 only those countries that were rich had had economic historians studying their past in sufficient detail to construct the data on which Maddison built his studies. Japan did not belong in Maddison's sample, I opined at a lunch at the Harvard Faculty Club. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, I said, all of the old estimates were very rough and inaccurate—and if you make an error in your estimate of 1870 that makes it 10% higher than it should be, the fact that you construct the growth rate by subtracting the log of income then from income now means that you automatically bias your regression coefficient toward -1. Your regression coefficient is then a weighted average of (a) a -1 that is the automatic arithmetic consequence of your errors in your 1870 estimates, and (b) the true coefficient you want to discovery, with the -1 being weighted higher the more error there is in your past estimates. And—I said (I was preaching and ranting by then)—there were a bunch of countries that people were confident back in 1870 were \"modern\" and had made the Rostovian takeoff. They should be in the sample too for a proper analysis!\n",
