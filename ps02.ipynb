    "### C. My take on what we see here\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw all this last problem set. We saw 69500 years during which humanity did not advance in standards of living, remaining desperately poor, while technology and population grew. By 1500 the human population was 5000 times what it had been 70000 years ago, and 70 times what it had been 8000 years ago. And our index of technology stood in 1770 at perhaps 80 times what it had been 70000 years and 8 times what it had been 8000 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all that time we saw two watersheds. The first was the invention of agriculture—or perhaps it was the settling-down—that mattered, as before 8000 years ago invention was limited by being restricted to those light and easy-to-carry tools you needed to flourish in new or changing environments. Moreover, after 8000 years ago, there was definitely a two-heads-are-better-than-one phenomenon as more people applying their brains and communicating with each other further increased the rate of growth. But then, after about the year 150, the proportional growth rate of the ideas stock dropped. Growth slowed down with this arrival of the mid-first millennium Eurasian dark age—the late-antiquity pause. That is our second watershed.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Then, 500 years ago, in 1500, we see a third watershed: the coming of the commercial revolution era and the knitting together economically of the entire world via ocean transport produced roughly a quadrupling in the proportional pace of ideas-stock growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Then, in 1770, we see a fourth watershed: the industrial revolution, at first very highly concentrated in the northwestern tip of Eurasian continent, that more than tripled the proportional rate of ideas stock growth from its already unprecedentedly commercial-revolution pace. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Then, in 1870, we see the coming (a) of full globalization as we know it, (b) of the industrial research lab to rationalize and routinize the creation and development of technologies, and (c) of the modern corporation to rationalize and routinize their global deployment, These brought the era of modern economic growth that we live in. In it the proportional growth rate of the human ideas stock has not been the 0.035% per year of the first millennium and a half, or the 0.15% per year of the commercial revolution era, or even the 0.45% per year of the 1770 to 1870 industrial revolution era. It has, rather, been more than four times as great as even this last: more than 2% per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the post-1870 modern economic growth era that has seen the real explosion of wealth. And it has been coupled with the demographic transition. Before 1870 growth in the ideas stock brought with it growth in population and not growth in typical living standards. Since 1870 humanity has decided it is rich enough to be able to afford to and to desire to restrict its fertility. So we now approach zero population growth. And we now have immense wealth in per capita terms. We now have almost 50 times as many people on the earth living almost 15 times as well as we had back in the year one.\n",

    "# 2. Modeling very long run economic history\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Basic assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model has three and only three three behavioral relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the average level of production and income E in the economy will be determined by the **production function**, which depends on two and only two things: the level of the current population P, and the current level of the ideas stock H. We write this production function mathematically as: \n",
    "\n",
    ">$ E = \\frac{H}{P^{1/ɣ}} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "The level of production and income E is equal to the ideas stock H divided by the population raised to the power (1/ɣ). A better technological and organizational toolbox of ideas H raises the level of per capita production and income. And a higher population reduces per capita production and income. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why this behavioral relationship? For Malthusian reasons. Limited resources mean that more people means smaller farm sizes, and less minerals per capita. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the proportional growth rate h of the ideas stock H will be determined by the **innovation function**. Within each era the innovation function will be the simplest thing possible—an era-specific constant value: \n",
    "\n",
    ">$ \\frac{dH/dt}{H} = h $\n",
    "\n",
    "The left hand side is simply the proportional growth rate of the ideas stock H, written in the notation that Isaac Newton chose for such things back in the late 1600s. The right hand side is simply a constant: the assumption is that, within a historical era, the stock of valuable ideas that powers human productivity grows at a constant rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this behavioral relationship? Because people are inventive and communicative, so they figure out better ways to solve problems of production and organization, and then those better ways diffuse around the world. That gives us a positive h. And we identify watersheds in the economic growth process by big changes in h.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the rate of growth n of the human population P will depend on the Malthusian **reproduction function**. In the Malthusian framework we use, n depends on the level of prosperity E: \n",
    "\n",
    ">$ \\frac{dP/dt}{P} = n = β  \\left( \\frac{E}{ϕ y_{sub}}-1 \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportional growth rate of the human population P—again using Newton's symbols—which we will also sometimes call n for convenience, depends on prosperity and income E divided by what the \"subsistence\" level of necessities consumption $ y_{sub} $ is times an index $ ϕ $ of the share of income that is spent not on fitness-enhancing necessities but on luxuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this behavioral relationship? Were humanity to be poorer, children would be less well-nourished, their immune systems would become compromised, and they would die in greater numbers. Thus population growth is an increasing function of per capita income. \n",
    "\n",
    "This behavioral relationship, however, breaks down after 1870, as humanity exits the Malthusian régime. There follow the demographic transition to lower fertility and forthcoming zero population growth. So this equation will hold only before 1870 or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three behavioral relationships have a number of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **production function** has one parameter ɣ, which governs how much more important ideas are in boosting productivity than limited resources are in sapping productivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The boring **innovation function** has its one parameter, its constant value h. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The Malthusian **reproduction function** has three parameters: \n",
    "    * β that tells us how much population growth accelerates or decelerates as living standards rise and fall; \n",
    "    * ϕ that tells us how much of income is spent on goods other than those that actually matter for health, fitness, and population growth; and \n",
    "    * $ y_{sub} $ that tells us at what level of spending on \"fitness\" or \"subsistence\" goods is human health and nutrition so poor that the population does not grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does an economy and, indeed, a species governed by these three behavioral relationship evolve and develop over time? \n",

    "\n",
    "We will run through five code cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first will initialize the economy we are modeling: we will, for now, start it up in the year -6000, with a human population on the earth of 7 million, and a level of production, prosperity, and income of 900 dollars _per capita_ per year—which is what the human living standard was back then, about at the level that the World Bank sees as roughly 2.50 a day.\n",

If you want to make twice as much steel, you need not just twice as many steelmaking firms, you need twice as many mines and miners as well. By contrast, if one steelmaking firm is using the basic oxygen process to transform what would otherwise become brittle cast iron into durable steel, that in no way impedes the ability of the steelmaking firm nextdoor to do the same.
